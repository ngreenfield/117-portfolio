        <p>I'm a 30-year-old U.S. Army veteran who proudly served for four years as a combat medic. My time in the military taught me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of staying calm under pressureâ€”qualities that continue to guide me in every aspect of life. That experience shaped my mindset and gave me a strong foundation for tackling challenges head-on.
                <br><br>
            These days, I channel that same focus and discipline into my passion for coding and programming. I love the process of building solutions, solving problems, and continually learning new technologies. Outside of tech, I enjoy video games, sim racing, swimming, and spending quality time with my dogs. Whether I'm writing code or racing a virtual track, I'm always looking for ways to grow, create, and stay engaged.</p>
